The following repository contains the climate and yield data and analysis scripts for Brook et al. (2026) "Genomic architecture and breeding trade-offs of coconut drought tolerance":

1. climate_data.csv - all the data climate data used in 001_modelling.R to develop drought metrics

2. yield_data.csv - all of the yield data used in 001_modelling.R to model the relationship between yield and drought

3. 001_modelling.R - all the code used to model the relationship between yield and drought (drought metric generation, drought metric and model selection, reaction norm fitting, drought sensitivity analysis, etc.)

4. 002_genomics.txt - all the code (BASH/Linux unless stated otherwise) used to assess the genomic basis of drought tolerance (GWAS, heritability, PRS, GBEV, genetic diversity, etc.)

N.B. genomic data is available at NCBI (LINK). The reference genome used in the bioinformatic analysis is available here: https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/datasets/genome/GCA_008124465.1/
